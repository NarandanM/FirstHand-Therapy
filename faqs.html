    </header>
    <article class="content">

    <p><strong>Physical therapy (PT), also known as physiotherapy, is one of the Medical health professions that, by using evidence-based kinesiology, exercise prescription, health education, mobilization, and electrical or physical agents, treats acute or chronic pain, movement and physical impairments resulting from injury, trauma or illness typically of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological and endocrinological origins. Physical therapy is used to improve a patient's physical functions through physical examination, diagnosis, prognosis, patient education, physical intervention, rehabilitation, disease prevention and health promotion. It is practiced by physical therapists (known as physiotherapists in many countries).</strong></p>

    <p>In addition to clinical practice, other activities encompassed in the physical therapy profession include research, education, consultation and administration. Physical therapy is provided as a primary care treatment or alongside, or in conjunction with, other medical services. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, physical therapists have the power to prescribe medication.</p>

    <p>Doctors often recommend physical therapy (PT) for kids and teens who have been injured or who have movement problems from an illness, disease, or disability.

      After an injury, physical therapists work to decrease pain, improve movement, and help kids return to daily activities. They teach kids exercises designed to help them regain strength and range of motion, and also show kids and families how to prevent future injuries.
      
      Physical therapy might be needed any time a problem with movement limits someone's daily activities.</p>

      <p>Pediatric physical therapy assists in early detection of health problems and uses a variety of modalities to provide physical therapy for disorders in the pediatric population. These therapists are specialized in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of infants, children, and adolescents with a variety of congenital, developmental, neuromuscular, skeletal, or acquired disorders/diseases. Treatments focus mainly on improving gross and fine motor skills, balance and coordination, strength and endurance as well as cognitive and sensory processing/integration.</p>

    <p>A boxer's fracture is the break of the 5th metacarpal bones of the hand near the knuckle. Occasionally it is used to refer to fractures of the 4th metacarpal as well. Symptoms include pain and a depressed knuckle.</p>

    <p>Classically, it occurs after a person hits an object with a closed fist. The knuckle is then bent towards the palm of the hand. Diagnosis is generally suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with X-rays.</p>

    <p>For most fractures with less than 70 degrees of angulation, buddy taping and a tensor bandage resulted in similar outcomes to reduction with splinting. In those with more than 70 degrees of angulation or in which the broken finger is rotated, reduction and splinting may be recommended.</p>

    <p>They represent about a fifth of hand fractures. They occur more commonly in males than females. Both short and long term outcomes are generally good. The knuckle, however, typically remains somewhat deformed.</p>

    <p>Metacarpal fractures are usually caused by the impact of a clenched fist with a hard, immovable object, such as a skull or a wall. When a punch impacts with improper form, the force occurs at an angle towards the palm, creating a dorsal bend in the bone, ultimately causing the fracture when the bone is bent too far.</p>

    <p>When a boxer punches with proper form, the knuckles of the second and third metacarpal align linearly with the articulating radius, followed linearly by the humerus. Due to the linear articulation of bones, the force is able to travel freely across these joints and bones and be dissipated without injury. Therefore, fractures of the second or third metacarpals are rare, with fractures of the 4th and 5th metacarpals comprising the vast majority of metacarpal fractures.</p>

    <p>Diagnosis by a doctor’s examination is the most common, often confirmed by x-rays. X-ray is used to display the fracture and the angulations of the fracture. A CT scan may be done in very rare cases to provide a more detailed picture.</p>

    <p>Tendonitis -
      When the tendons in the hands become inflamed from overuse or repetitive motion, a musician can suffer from tendonitis. This condition causes severe pain and makes it virtually impossible to play any instrument using the hand. One common type is known as de Quervain’s Disease which inflames the base of the thumb.
      
      If not treated properly, it can lead to a chronic problem and irreversible damage.</p>
      
      <p> Tunnel Syndrome -
      You don’t have to be a professional performer to have carpal tunnel syndrome. It can afflict young musicians just beginning to practice and play their instrument. Common among percussionists, carpal tunnel syndrome causes tingling and numbness along with weakness in the affected hand. If the median nerve becomes compressed or pinched, it causes the tendons around the nerve to swell with the result being the pain of carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
      
      <p> Finger -
      Trigger finger is also known as stenosing tenosynovitis. When inflammation narrows the space between the cover or sheath of a tendon in a finger, the finger can get locked into position. When stuck in a bent position, it makes a snapping or clicking sound when straightened. With musicians, it is usually caused by prolonged and forceful gripping of an instrument.</p>
      
      <p>Thoracic Outlet Syndrome -
      This condition causes numbness of the hand or arm, an aching limb, or discoloration of the hand. This can be caused by playing a string instrument like the viola or violin. When the blood vessels or nerves between your collarbone and first rib (thoracic outlet) are compressed, it results in shoulder and neck pain, and numbness within the fingers.</p>
      
      <p>Thumb Arthritis -
      This particular condition is quite common in older individuals and can cause severe pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion and strength of the thumb. For musicians, thumb arthritis can easily prevent them from pinching or grasping certain instruments.</p>
      
      <p>Flexor Tenosynovitis -
      This condition causes numbness and swelling in the fingers during and shortly after playing an instrument. If caused by an infection, it can be an emergency situation that needs to be treated immediately by a hand surgery specialist.</p>
      
      <p>Cubital Tunnel Syndrome -
      Often confused with carpal tunnel syndrome, the pain from cubital tunnel syndrome is usually centered on the inside of the elbow. A tingling sensation is often reported by patients when their elbow is bent. Many musicians who must keep their elbows in a bent position can suffer from this condition.</p>
